                <h2>A Little Bit About the Creator</h2>
                <p>Hi my name is Logan! I’m a computer science student at BYU-Idaho, currently in my fourth semester, working towards my bachelor’s degree. I live in Tennessee and have a passion for technology, with experience in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, and C#. Outside of programming, I enjoy camping, spending quality time with friends, and playing video games, especially in multiplayer settings.
                <br><br>
                As a child, I was captivated by LEGOs, and they became my favorite pastime. They not only fueled my creativity but also inspired my love for building and problem-solving. To share this passion, I created a website dedicated to showcasing my interest in LEGOs and their endless possibilities. I hope you appreciate my work and find it inspiring!
                <br><br>
                I actively work on coding projects and share my progress on GitHub. Feel free to explore my repositories and see what I’ve been working on by clicking the link at the bottom of this page.</p>
